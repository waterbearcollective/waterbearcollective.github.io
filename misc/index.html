Edge Collective promotes technological sovereignty for communities living at ‘the edge’, including vulnerable cities, rural townships, farming communities, and islands.
</p>
We facilitate workshops, trainings, and collaborative development focused on building locally-owned, free and open-source municipal and community infrastructure.
</p>
Recent projects include resilient telecom systems, off-grid water monitoring, and retrofitting of greenhouse control systems.
</p>
<p>You can view all of our designs and code on <a href="http://github.com/edgecollective">github</a>.</p>
